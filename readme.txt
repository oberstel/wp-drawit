Draw and edit flow charts, diagrams, images and more while editing a post.

== Description ==

DrawIt is a WordPress plugin that interfaces with the draw.io website to easily create beautiful diagrams, flow charts and drawings inline while you are editing a post. This powerful plugin saves the draw.io source code for your diagram and a PNG or SVG version of the image â€“ providing crisp images that you can update without redrawing the diagram. There is also no hassle moving images back and forth between editors on your computer like typically is done without this plugin.

There are multiple ways to add a diagram, use whichever is most convenient for you: through the Media Library, the visual editor or the text editor.

This plugin connects directly to the draw.io website, which is a high-quality diagram and flow chart tool with a feature set on par with other well-known diagram editors (like Microsoft Visio), so the interface will already be intuitive. Best of all, it is **free!**

== Installation ==

1. Go to WP admin > Plugins > Add New
1. Search for "DrawIt" in the search field, press Enter.
1. Click "Install Now"
1. Click "Activate Plugin"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I edit a diagram? =

To edit a diagram that you've already created, just select it (e.g., the source code in the text post editor or the image itself in the visual post editor) and then click on the DrawIt button in the editor!

= How do I report a bug or feature request? =

Please report all bugs and feature requests through the [DrawIt support page on WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/drawit) or through the [Google+ DrawIt community](https://plus.google.com/communities/112051242587930767153).

= Where is the source code for my diagram saved? =

The source code for the diagram is saved with the image in your WordPress installation. As long as you do not delete the image from your media library, then you will be able to open and edit the image from the post/page editor where it is being used.

= How do I edit a diagram that is only in the media library and not inserted into a post? =

For now, you'll have to insert it into a post to be able to edit it. We'll work on improving this later.

= How can I add links in an SVG image? (A.K.A, What are "insecure" SVG images?) =

You can enable links in SVG images by enabling the "Use insecure version for SVG images" setting. This setting refers to a tradeoff for using SVG images. If you want to be able to have advanced SVG features (e.g., having clickable links within the image), then this needs to be enabled. But a tradeoff is that this inserts raw SVG code into the web page, which introduced security holes. You should not enable this option unless you trust all possible sources or creators of SVG files that you will have on your site. Another side-effect of enabling this option is that the image code in the post editor gets replaced with a shortcode in the format of `[drawit-svg ...]` to help keep the editor clean from a lot of raw SVG data, but you also won't be able to see the image in the visual editors - you'll only be able to see the shortcode text.

Please read up more on the vulnerabilities of using SVG images on your website -- here is a very brief introduction: [SVG Uploads in WordPress (the Inconvenient Truth)](https://bjornjohansen.no/svg-in-wordpress)
