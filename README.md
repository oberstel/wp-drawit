# wp-drawit 1.1.4
Wordpress Plugin to use Draw.io

# Description
DrawIt is a WordPress plugin that interfaces with the draw.io website to easily create beautiful diagrams, flow charts and drawings inline while you are editing a post. This powerful plugin saves the draw.io source code for your diagram and a PNG or SVG version of the image â€“ providing crisp images that you can update without redrawing the diagram. There is also no hassle moving images back and forth between editors on your computer like typically is done without this plugin.

There are multiple ways to add a diagram, use whichever is most convenient for you: through the Media Library, the visual editor or the text editor.

This plugin connects directly to the draw.io website, which is a high-quality diagram and flow chart tool with a feature set on par with other well-known diagram editors (like Microsoft Visio), so the interface will already be intuitive.
